      <p class="blog_part">
        So, first of all: what is #JuxStyleChallenge? It's a small design
        challenge, contested by a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@juxtopposed/videos" class="func"
          >youtube channel Juxtopposed</a
        >
        (Go watch her videos, they're amazing). And so I tried to participate! I
        don't want to use XTwitter, so I'll just post it here. Seriously, who
        can stop me?

      <p class="blog_part">7 days, 7 design styles.</p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 1: <span class="string">"Y2K"</span></p>
      <p class="blog_part">
        Y2K - Stands for early 2000's. So, that's what I got:
      </p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_1.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        Y2K was the hardest one for me. You see, I don't actually know how
        website looked like in the 2000's. My work was based on the designs I
        found in Google search. Fonts were already obvious, and I got the
        palette from
        <a
          href="https://coolors.co/palette/fdc5f5-f7aef8-b388eb-8093f1-72ddf7"
          class="func"
          >coolors.co</a
        >. I'm pretty much sure it's unaccurate. The fact that I found good
        Windows XP window (Funny) template is already an achievement. The
        aesthetic is not so good anyways, at least in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 2: <span class="string">"Minimalism"</span></p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_2.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        And this one was my favorite! Minimalism is one of the best art styles,
        at least for me. My inspiration was a design group from Kosovo named
        <a href="https://deepyellow.net" class="func">Deep Yellow</a>. I've used
        an angular shade to mimic the 3d effect. From latin, "fiscus" can be
        translated as a moneybag. I think it's pretty easy to realize this is a
        financial company. The colors were just taken from the roof. Up to the
        next one!
      </p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 3: <span class="string"> "Skeuomorphism"</span></p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_3.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        Skeuomorphism is about making the asset look real. Like if it was a
        photo of an object. It was very popular at the beginning of the previous
        decade. Right after then, it was absolutely hated and underrated. Long
        story short, realistic designs have made us stagnate. But now,
        Skeuomorphism has its second breath i'd say. I always've thought it
        looked cool.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 4: <span class="string">"Glassmorphism"</span></p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_4.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        Glassmorphism is trying to have a look of glass. Maybe not so polished
        one, but glass. This style is way more flexible than you might think!
        You can make it look more neon, like a bubble or even something from
        sci-fi movies. It got very popular over the past few years. Because it
        has become so much easier to recreate. Glassmorphism is a trend, a good
        one.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 5: <span class="string">"Neobrutalism"</span></p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_5.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        Neobrutalism is so good. I've used uh... "black" version of it? Because
        you can make it look more funky, or conversely, more elegant and
        art-chaotic. As again, company's name is a latin word, which stands for
        "stock" or "store".
      </p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 6: <span class="string">"Grainy"</span></p>
      <div class="group">
        <img src="../content/Jux_chal_6_1.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
        <img src="../content/Jux_chal_6_2.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      </div>
      <p class="blog_part">
        This one is a business card! I know it's technically off the rules, but
        the whole point was just to try different styles. The phrases I've used
        are so naive and cliche, but after all, it's more of a template. I'd
        totally use a card like this if I needed to. Yes, it's only a grainy
        gradient, not a grainy object or grainy... everything.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_part">And, the final one is....</p>
      <p class="blog_h">Day 7: <span class="string">"Modern"</span></p>
      <img src="../content/Jux_chal_7.png" alt="" class="blog_pic" />
      <p class="blog_part">
        In a more direct way. For me, "modern" means actual art modern, and not
        something trendy and present. So, I've tried to make it look like a
        modern style painting.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_part">
        This is all I've got! I've spent a plenty of time on these. The
        challenge was great.
